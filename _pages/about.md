[Command: bundle exec jekyll serve]: #

I am currently a graduate student in [Department of Computer and Information Science][UPenn CIS] at the [University of Pennsylvania][UPenn]. 

In May 2023, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from [Schreyer Honors College][SHC] at Penn State, where I was honored to serve as the College of Engineering [Student Marshal][CoE Student Marshal News] and received [Outstanding Undergraduate Research Achievement Award][Outstanding Undergraduate Research Achievement], recognizing my academic excellence, research accomplishments, and leadership. During my time at Penn State, I was fortunate enough to work with Professors [Jinchao Xu][Jinchao Xu], [Syed Rafiul Hussain][Syed Rafiul Hussain], and [Shagufta Mehnaz][Shagufta Mehnaz] on various research projects.


# Research Interest
I am interested in developing machine learning that is fundamentally trustworthy. This involves ensuring properties such as correctness, robustness, privacy, fairness, and interpretability with mathematical guarantees.

Lately, I have been investigating the tension/tradeoff between various trustworthiness objectives (e.g., security, privacy, fairness, transparency). Specifically, my focus was on studying

- how model explanation relates to adversarial example generation?
- how can explanation be utilized to generate (attack) and detect (defense) adversarial examples?

By exploring these issues, we can establish principles for constructing secure and transparent machine learning systems in the face of potential threats.

I am also interested in addressing emerging challenges associated with large language models (LLMs), such as adversarial prompting.
