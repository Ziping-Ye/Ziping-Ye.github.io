I am currently a graduate researcher at the University of Pennsylvania [Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS)][UPenn CIS]. I recently graduated from Penn State [Schreyer Honors College][SHC] where I was fortunate to work with Professors [Jinchao Xu][Jinchao Xu], [Syed Rafiul Hussain][Syed Rafiul Hussain] and [Shagufta Mehnaz][Shagufta Mehnaz].


Research Interest
======
My research interests center around machine learning and security. I am interested in developing fundamentally trustworthy machine learning, focusing on correctness, robustness, fairness, and interpretability with mathematical guarantees. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to solve security problems, such as intrusion detection, malware detection, etc.

Recently, I am investigating the tension/tradeoff between different trustworthiness objectives (e.g., security, privacy, fairness, transparency). Specifially, I am studying

- how model explanation relates to adversarial example generation?
- how explanation can be used to generate (attack) and detect (defense) adversarial examples?
