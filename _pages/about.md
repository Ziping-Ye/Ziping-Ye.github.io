I am currently a graduate researcher at the [University of Pennsylvania][UPenn] [Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS)][UPenn CIS]. I recently graduated from Penn State [Schreyer Honors College][SHC] where I was fortunate to work with Professors [Jinchao Xu][Jinchao Xu], [Syed Rafiul Hussain][Syed Rafiul Hussain] and [Shagufta Mehnaz][Shagufta Mehnaz].



# Research Interest
My research interests center around machine learning and security. I am interested in developing fundamentally trustworthy machine learning, focusing on correctness, robustness, fairness, and interpretability with mathematical guarantees. I am also interested in applying machine learning techniques to solve security problems, such as intrusion detection, malware detection, etc.

Lately, I have been investigating the tension/tradeoff between different trustworthiness objectives (e.g., security, privacy, fairness, transparency). Specifially, I am studying

- how model explanation relates to adversarial example generation
- how explanation can be used to generate (attack) and detect (defense) adversarial examples

Exploring these issues will provide guidelines to develop safe explainable machine learning system given the existence of adversaries.
